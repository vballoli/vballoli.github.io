title: "Chanakya: Learning Tradeoffs for Adaptive Streaming Perception"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-08-20-adaptive-streaming-perception
excerpt: 'We propose Chanakya, a learned approximate execution framework, to automatically learn optimal decision trade-offs while being aware of both intrinsic (content) and extrinsic (system) characteristics. Chanakya cohesively optimizes latency and accuracy simultaneously through novel reward functions to learn optimum execution policies for many scenarios flexibly. We perform an extensive evaluation of our approach on both server-class GPUs and edge devices such as Jetson Xavier NX and AGX. We show that our approach with significantly low overhead outperforms state-of-the-art static and dynamic policies on public datasets in a variety of scenarios.'
