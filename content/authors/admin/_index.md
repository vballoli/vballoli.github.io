üëã Hi, I'm Vaibhav Balloli, a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India. I'm also an incoming graduate student at [Realize Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/realize-lab) with [Prof. Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly](https://sites.google.com/view/elizabethbondi) at the University of Michigan. I'm broadly interested in the intersection of sequential decision making and it's applications in AI for Social Good. At Microsoft Research India, I've worked on [HAMS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hams/), [Project Vasudha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vasudha/) and Project VeLLM. I'm a proponent of Open Source and also pretty active in developing in and contributing to Open Source, so do checkout my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/vballoli).
