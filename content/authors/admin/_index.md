üëã Hi, I'm Vaibhav Balloli, a Ph.D. candidate at [Realize Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/realize-lab) advised by [Prof. Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly](https://sites.google.com/view/elizabethbondi) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I broadly research designing and deploying human-centered AI systems that alleviate specific societal issues. My research topics include human-AI collaborative systems, multi-agent systems and LLMs. I'm currently working on [improving access to reproductive health information](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/stories/elizabeth-bondi-kelly-and-alex-peahl-receive-google-grant-to-develop-ai-powered-reproductive-health-chatbot) using LLMs and LLM-powered agents!

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, I've worked on [HAMS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hams/), [Project Vasudha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vasudha/) and [Project VeLLM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-vellm/). I'm a proponent of Open Source and also pretty active in developing in and contributing to Open Source, so do checkout my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/vballoli).
