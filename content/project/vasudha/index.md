# Vasudha Overview

Transportation and Electricity generation are the two major sectors contributing to more than 55% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and related climate change concerns. Hence, the primary pathways for decarbonization include the fast adaption of renewable energy sources in the energy mix and the use of more sustainable transportation alternatives like electric vehicles. The rapid adaption of renewable energy and e-mobility demands new technology solutions and business models to reduce their CAPEX and OPEX to make the technology affordable. Additionally, it demands intelligent infrastructure for robust and safe operations.

Vasudha is a collection of projects that offer AI and IoT-enabled technology solutions to drive sustainability goals and address the challenges mentioned above.

We are currently working on the following research problems:

1. Optimization of distributed energy resources (DERs) for carbon and price arbitrage under the stochasticity of energy generation and market prices using discrete and stochastic optimization techniques.
