Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !!! I'm Vaibhav Balloli, SCAI Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, Bengaluru.

My academic interests include Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Systems and Networks, Computer Architecture and their intersections. I play guitar, read fiction, listen to podcasts(special mention: [Lex Fridman AI podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4)), spend time on Twitter and YouTube following and reading about various researchers and their research projects, mostly in the field of Deep Learning(special mention: [MSR](https://www.youtube.com/user/MicrosoftResearch), [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew), [Henry AI Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHB9VepY6kYvZjj0Bgxnpbw), [ML Street Talk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMLtBahI5DMrt0NPvDSoIRQ), [Allen Institute of AI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqgmyWChwvt6MFGGlmUQCQ) and many more. I often write articles on my [personal blog](https://vballoli.github.io/blog) about various things and enjoy talking about movies, TV series, Machine Learning and Hardware. I also write an [academic blog](https://tourdeml.github.io/blog) containing paper summaries, code implementations/tutorials, etc. Do give it a read if you're interested in that sort of stuff.

I'm a huge supporter of Open Source and believe in it's principles. I often contributing to many of the libraries and frameworks I like, including PyTorch, Swift for TensorFlow, JAX, Flax, Flower (Federated Learning), you can check my contributions on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/vballoli). I also blog about various [research papers I read, annotate on my research blog](https://vballoli.github.io/research-papers/) and [talk about fundamentals of RL on a separate one](https://vballoli.github.io/rl-journey/). To help improve the research culture back in my undergraduate days, [I co-founded a group for discussing interesting papers in the broad field of Machine Learning](https://cspdf-bphc.github.io). Check out my projects and research work and DM me on Twitter if you want to discuss about anything!!

<!--Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities to pursue research/work in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Hardware Systems and their intersection.-->
