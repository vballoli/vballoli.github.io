Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !!! I'm Vaibhav Balloli, SCAI Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, Bengaluru.

My academic interests include Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Hardware Systems and Networks, specifically looking into problems studying and applying these techniques in tackling efficiency and for sustainability. Outside of research, I play guitar, read fiction, listen to podcasts(special mention: [TWIML AI Podcast](https://twimlai.com/)). You can also find some of my articles on my [personal blog](https://vballoli.com) about various things and enjoy talking about movies, TV series, Machine Learning and Hardware. I also write an [academic blog](https://tourdeml.github.io/blog) containing paper summaries, code implementations/tutorials, etc. Do give it a read if you're interested in that sort of stuff.

I'm a huge supporter of Open Source and believe in its future. I often contributing to many of the libraries and frameworks I like, including PyTorch, Swift for TensorFlow, JAX, Flax, Flower (Federated Learning), you can check my contributions on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/vballoli). I've worked on Smartphone-based Driver License Testing that is deployed in multiple states with 10+ cities in India. Find more at [Automated License Testing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hams/#!automated-driver-license-testing) and [Dashboard](https://hams-dashboard.westus3.cloudapp.azure.com/). A low-cost, smartphone-based system for automating a driver license test at MSR India.

<!--Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities to pursue research/work in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Hardware Systems and their intersection.-->
