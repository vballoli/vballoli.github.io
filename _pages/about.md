Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !!! I'm Vaibhav Balloli, Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, Bengaluru.

At Microsoft Research, I'm currently working on Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization in the context of Energy providers as a part of [Project Vasudha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vasudha/) for Sustainability. More specifically, my research delves into:

**Iâ€™m currently looking for Ph.D opportunities to pursue research in the intersection of Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning, specifically into topcics like Representation Learning, Multi-task Learning and Efficient adaptation. Please shoot me an email @ [balloli.vb@gmail.com](mailto:balloli.vb@gmail.com) if you feel I'm a good fit in your or your colleague's group.**

1. Scaling different RL algorithms and stochastic optimization methods to cover various energy-optimzation scenarios, like cost savings, profitability and  carbon emission savings (used as solutions for partners with Microsoft to employ algorithms that are cost effective and efficient). To this end, we author a framework called [EnCortex](../_publications/2022-09-21-encortex.md) that focuses on composing various industrial-scenarios to employ stochastic optimization and RL-based algorithms. 
2. Safe Reinforcement Learning algorithms that apply to the energy domain. This framework allows domain-experts to efficiently compose different components and scenarios while providing first-class MLOps through Azure ML and scaling support to neural-networks based optimization like Deep RL and other methods.

I was also involved in [HAMS's](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hams/) Smartphone-based Driver License Testing that is deployed in multiple states with 10+ cities in India, where I improved the architecture and efficiency of various Computer Vision Pipelines at various deployments across the country. Our work was featured in national [publications](https://www.punjabnewsexpress.com/punjab/news/punjabs-automated-driving-test-tracks-to-be-upgraded-with-state-of-the-art-technology-laljit-singh-bhullar-167807). I've worked on . Find more at [Automated License Testing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hams/#!automated-driver-license-testing) and [Dashboard](https://hams-dashboard.westus3.cloudapp.azure.com/). A low-cost, smartphone-based system for automating a driver license test at MSR India. Additionally, I was also involved in researching [Streaming Perception using Contextual Bandits](../_publications/2022-08-20-adaptive-streaming-perception.md) and their deployment on Edge devices.

My academic interests include Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning, specifically looking into applying and advancing these techniques for Social Good. My research until now has tackled various societal impact like [improving road-safety by automating driving tests](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hams/), [round-the-clock optimization to decrease carbon emissions of energy-providers](../_publications/2022-09-21-encortex.md) and [devising applications](../_publications/2019-03-22-ovssvc.md) that can be used in natural disasters.  

Outside of research, I play guitar, read fiction, listen to podcasts(special mention: [TWIML AI Podcast](https://twimlai.com/)), play Pool and Table Tennis(you can often find me teaching some TT at the MSR India office). You can also find some of my articles on my [personal blog](https://vballoli.com) about various things and enjoy talking about movies, TV series, Machine Learning and Hardware. I also write an [academic blog](https://vballoli.github.io/VLog) containing paper summaries, code implementations/tutorials, etc, something I think you'll be very intrigued to read. I'm very interested in scientific writing, so if you've read any of my writings, a feedback is greatly appreciated.  

I'm a huge supporter of Open Source and believe in its future. I often contributing to many of the libraries and frameworks I use, including PyTorch, JAX, and many more, which you can find on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/vballoli).
